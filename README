Script to automate grading of all hw5 submissions for CS182 downloaded from Blackboard.
The script 
- unpacks submissions (supporting all major compression formats - zip, rar, etc.)
- creates a directory for every student and copies Blackboard submission info file corresponding to each student dir
- finds students who didn't follow the submission guidelines
- fixes faulty student directories
- copies grader and other supporting files to all user directories
- runs grader on all student submissions and generates a report for every student. 
- reports stuents whose submissions fail to compile.

Note:
If the patool fails to unpack a file, install the necessary executable such as unrar, unzip, etc. using brew or apt-get
